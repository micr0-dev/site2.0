**An oppressed state, is a sad state
A Surveilled state, Is a complaint state.**

When you don't know what a state is doing, not only must you assume that the state is doing what is best for them. But also that they are doing everything they can, to know what *you* are doing.

Who is the state? Who is they? If you don't know who they are, they are hiding. Why are they hiding? Imagining why one person is hiding is easy. But imagining, or understanding why a collective is is hiding... is impossible. A collective is a group, yes, but even within any one collective, people act within there best interests. And when their best interests are inline with the collective they act as part of it. How strongly they feel about still being a part of that collective is a whole other deal, where they start to question their part in it.

Don't assume one unknown. Playing with only one path forward is like playing online chess where you pre-make your move, before your opponent has even made their move.

Can you do it when you feel in control? Maybe, but thinking you are in complete control is the first mistake.

Your control depends on the belief that you know how they will move. That, they will move in what is best for them. But once they know what you expect, that shifts the scales. That is no longer the best thing for them. For infinity and infinity. For that is a paradox and a superposition. From this point forth, you can no longer think in moves. You must think in probability. Like an algorithm. It is very easy to let yourself run wild, imagine things that, seem improbable, but because they are improbable they start to look probable. That is when, a mind begins to break. Which is why you must avoid that at all cost. There are several ways to prevent yourself from reaching the breaking point. One of the best is to rely on you subconscious, on your ego, and even on occasion on your super ego. If you feel that something is right but cant even explain why. That *IS* why. That feeling alone *IS* enough evidence, its what you, the deeper mind, is telling you.

Surveillance isn't just about surveilling you, its about getting you to surveil yourself. Self-censor. When ideas you have automatically go through a filter that's baked into your own head. when your whole mind and structure shape to the mold of the one surveillancing you.

You start second guessing. You start feeling uncomfortable when you do what you want to do. You *willingly*, become complicit. Foucault's panopticon.

We may hold trust, it may be in some people who are close to us. But as soon as that trust is breached. they become a part of 'the collective' or 'the they' if you will.

And this is when we realize. the collective is the one whom you can never trust. 

The surveillance state isn't a collective, its a intricate machine of the collective. single people who became entrenched in their own imagined versions of the collective. Protecting another's secret protects your's.

And this is where surveillance makes paranoia rational

This is the trap. The surveillance doesn't need to catch you doing something wrong. It just needs to make you afraid you might even *look* wrong. And in that fear, you disappear yourself. You become complicit in your own erasure.

The watched can never win the game, and the collective knows that

They can track your:
Location, Communications, Purchases, Relationships, Clicks, Views, Opinions...

But they can't track your subconscious. 

Resistance works when you do what feels right to you. Because your subconscious is more powerful, than you could ever be.
