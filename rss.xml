            <title>What if social media moderated itself?</title>
            <link>https://yoursite.com/blog/html/gradient.html</link>
            <description>I've been thinking about social media a lot lately. Not in the way most
                people think about it, scrolling, posting, whatever. I mean thinking about the
                fundamental structure of how these platforms work and why they all seem to fail in
                their own special ways. Big tech social media is surveillance. That's not hyperbole,
                that's just what it is. Every click tracked, every interaction analyzed, every piece
                of data sold or used to predict your behavior.</description>

            <title>An oppressed state, is a sad state. A surveilled state, is a complaint state.</title>

            <description>When you don't know what a state is doing, not only must you assume that
                the state is doing what is best for them. But also that they are doing everything
                they can, to know what you are doing. Who is the state? Who is they? If you don't
                know who they are, they are hiding.</description>
